FP-TS Sync-Example (read file/parse yaml synchronously)

Learning FP-TS and trying to work with some real world examples.

This project was just to see that I can go this synchronously. I am actually trying to work with an asychronous versions of this project (https://github.com/anotherhale/fp-ts_async-example) and would like any feedback or help with that project.
